                <p>
                    My doctoral research operates at the intersection of classical signal processing and modern machine learning. The primary goal is to develop robust, efficient, and interpretable algorithms for analyzing complex time-series data, with a special emphasis on biomedical applications such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG). We aim to move beyond "black-box" models by integrating domain-specific knowledge into the learning process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This involves exploring hybrid models that leverage the mathematical rigor of signal transforms (like Fourier or Wavelet transforms) as feature extractors for deep neural networks. By doing so, we can reduce the dimensionality of the input data, enforce invariances, and improve model generalization, especially in data-scarce environments.

                <p>
                    A significant part of my work focuses on creating models that are computationally efficient enough to run on low-power, wearable devices. This is critical for real-time health monitoring. To achieve this, I investigate techniques like model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. An important theoretical tool in this process is the formulation of a loss function, such as the binary cross-entropy for a classification task, which we seek to minimize:
                    $$
                    \mathcal{L}(\theta) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left[ y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i) \right]
                    $$
                    Here, $y_i$ is the true label and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability for the $i$-th sample. By optimizing this function, we train the model to make accurate predictions.
